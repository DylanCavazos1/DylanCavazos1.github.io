# Milestone Three: Data Structures and Algorithms

This enhancement was created to support my knowledge and experience with implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure that utilizes In-Order Traversal to effectively search and perform user management on course data.  

## Key Features: 
- Introduced a standalone 'bst.py' class to encapsulate the core logic of the data structure
- Supports CSV loading into a BST data structure
- Enables the insertion, searching, updating, and deletion of courses inside the BST

## Reflection:
This enhancement reflects my ability to apply algorithmic principles and performance optimization techniques aligned with industry standards. Replacing the original Hash Table with a Binary Search Tree presented new design challenges that improved the structure and search efficiency of the application.

Throughout this process, I learned to navigate real-world problems such as managing tree-based data, implementing recursive algorithms, and ensuring data integrity. These improvements contribute to a smoother and more scalable user experience, reinforcing my skills in both data structures and software development.
