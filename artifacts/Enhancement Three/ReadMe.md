# Milestone Four: Databases

This enhancement was created to introduce a PostgreSQL relational database for persistent data storage in the Course Manager application.   

## Key Features: 
- Included a db.py class that encapsulated the logic concerning database integration using Python's 'psycopg2' library
- Introduces data synchronization between in-memory Binary Search Tree and the PostgreSQL database
- Supports CRUD functionality for users to perform operations that are persistent across applications

## Reflection:
The enhancement with the inclusion of a database allowed me to gain hands-on experience with implementing a relational database using an application built in Python. I gained familiarity with a database I haven't used before, especially within a Python application. This gave me an opportunity to apply skills gained from previous courses and adapt them to a new technology.
