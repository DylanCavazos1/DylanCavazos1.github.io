# Milestone Two: Software Design and Engineering

This artifact was created to support my knowledge and experience with applying software design and engineering principles towards enhancing a program with a more modular and readable language such as Python.  

# Key Features: 
- Currently there is a 'Course' class and 'CourseManager_Python' class
- Supports CSV loading into a data structure like a dictionary
- CLI interface with CRUD operations 

# Reflection:
This enhancement showcased my ability to deliver a program that utilizes object-oriented file structure, supporting a class object design, with in-memory loading capability for maintainabiliyt and user management.
