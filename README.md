# CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio 

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio, this portfolio showcases the culmination of skills, knowledge, and techniques acquired during my educational journey. Within are the three enhancements of my Course Manager project, demonstrating the three key areas of the Computer Science Capstone, software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases.

## About my Portfolio
This ePortfolio highlights the three key areas of enhancement developed using the Course Manager project:

### Enhancement One - Software Design and Engineering
- Rewrote the C++ Course Manager program in Python.
- Applied object-oriented principles to improve the codebase for improved maintainability.
- Replaced the Hash Table data structure with a built-in Python dictionary. 
- Added CRUD operations with input validation and robust exception handling.
- Included a Course class responsible for the creation and formatting of course objects.

### Enhancement Two - Software Design and Engineering
- Replaced the dictionary from first enhancement with a fully functional Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Implemented in-order traversal, insertion, deletion, and search logic.
- Included validation logic to mitigate redundant course logic for prerequisites.
- Refactored the command-line interface main menu to gracefully handle loading data.
- Improved the Main Menu design for an improved seamless user experience.

### Enhancement Three - Databases
- Integrated PostgreSQL with the Python Course Manager application using 'psycopg2' library.
- Enabled persistent storage and synchronization between the in-memory BST and the database.
- Implemented full CRUD database operations with validation and secure design patterns.

## Usage
1. Open the Course Manager program
2. Load the Courses CSV file
3. Print Course List
4. Create, Search, Update, or Delete courses
5. Sync data between in-memory (BST) and database

## Requirements
- IDE that fully supports Python
- Access to PostgreSQL if utilizing
