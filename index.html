                This repository contains the enhanced version of my Course Manager project, featuring a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient in-memory traversal and integration with a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage:

                Originally, this CLI application used a hash table to manage course data loaded from a CSV file. I enhanced the program by:

                <li>Implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) for in-memory course retrieval</li>
                <li>Integrating PostgreSQL for persistent course data between sessions</li>
                <li>Adding synchronization options between the BST and the database</li>
                <li>Including CLI functionality to support full CRUD operations</li>

            <h2>Software Design and Engineering</h2>
            <p>
                The first enhancement for the Software Design and Engineering artifact was the conversion to Python from C++ Course Manager project.
                Originally, this program loaded course data from a CSV file and utilized a Hash Table to store the courses for retrieval and management. This enhancement is aimed at creating
                a program that utilizes object-oriented principles in a more maintainable and readable language such as Python. Currently, it utilizes 
                a dictionary to store the course objects and allows a user to perform various operations like Create, Read, Update, or Delete any courses.
