      <p>Originally, the Course Manager program utilized a Hash Table as the primary data structure along with a linked-list for handling cases when the current node was already occupied by a course. For this enhancement I wanted to replace the 
        Hash Table with a Binary Search Tree that would use In-Order Traversal to efficiently search for a specific course using a tree node structure. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In the Binary Search Tree, the courses would be arranged in a hierarchical structure
        with courses whose course ID were lower, they would become the sub-trees from their respective parent nodes. This data structure allows for more efficient searching when needing to perform operations on a course object, such as adding
        a course, editing a current course, or deleting a course, and also printing the course list.

      <p>
        For this enhancement, I introduced a Binary Search Tree class that would handle the insertion, traversal, and CRUD functionality related to course objects. Upon each method, that method would recursively call itself until the desired 
        node storing the course object was found. For example, when searching for a course the search function used recursion to traverse the subtree to determine if the course ID of that course object was lesser or greater than the current Node
        until the desired course was obtained. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The BST also utilizes In-Order Traversal to retrieve and display the courses in sorted order, the in-order traversal method recursively traverses the trees and stores the courses in an empty list, sorts them
        and returns the complete list sorted according to course ID. The BST was implemented in a separate class to maintain modularity and clean structure, while the Course Manager class interacted with its methods for course operations. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The CRUD operations were also modified to replacing the dictionary with BST-based logic, that way the operations performed by the user would utilize searching, insertion, and deletion when needing to perform course management.

        This artifact builds upon the Course Manager project originally created in CS 300 and used a hash table to store course data.  
        This enhancement represents a major milestone in my understanding of data structures and algorithmic problem-solving. I implemented a complete Binary Search Tree (BST) that supports core operations like searching, 
        insertion, deletion, and in-order traversal. These improvements significantly enhanced the application's performance, organization, and scalability.
        <br>
        <br>
        I prioritized secure and maintainable software design by preventing circular dependencies, duplicate course entries, and invalid prerequisites. To reinforce these areas, I created separate classes for the BST structure and for the validation logic, making the application more modular and testable. 
        This enhancement demonstrates my technical growth as well as my ability to create real-world solutions using efficient data structures.  
        Through this enhancement, I met course outcomes related to designing algorithmic solutions and implementing secure software architecture.
