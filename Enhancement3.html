        The third enhancement focused on introducing a database to the selected artifact. For this enhancement, I chose to integrate a relational database into the Course Manager project using PostgreSQL. I selected this
        database because it integrated well with Python, and I also wanted to gain experience working with a relational database I hadn't used before. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In my enhancement I created a connection to the Course Manager application that would store
        relevant course details related to the Course ID, Course Title, and any existing prerequisites. This enhancement enables users to maintain persistent data across sessions and retrieve course information without reloading.

      <p>
        The database implementation connects directly to a PostgreSQL relational database, storing relevant course details for user management. This connection utilizes the psycopg2 python library that integrates with PostgreSQL directly using 
        database user credentials for access. I wanted the user interaction to be smooth and the process of storing course details in the database to be intuitive and efficient. Upon loading the courses directly from the CSV file, the application
        automatically syncs the data to the database. This eliminates the need for users to manually reload courses into PostgreSQL each time the application starts.
        <br>
        <br>
        I integrated the CRUD operations to be synced
        with the database also, ensuring that if a user performs an operation such as updating or deleting it would also remove those course(s) from the database, requiring minimal redundant operations. I also added features such as printing courses 
        currently stored in the database, as well as inserting individual courses when needed. This meant that a user is able to distinguish between the courses they are currently managing directly in the application versus the ones that are stored in the database. 
        This feature helps users track their progress in course management and database storage.
        <br>
        <br>
        A few other features I included was the ability to sync the Course Manager application directly with the database. 
        This meant that if multiple changes have occurred during user interactions, the database syncs instantly with all current courses in the Binary Search Tree (BST). The introduction of a database like PostgreSQL has made course management even easier for users, 
        ensuring persistent and secure data storage throughout the applicationâ€™s use.

        This final enhancement allowed me to fully expand my Course Manager application by integrating a PostgreSQL database to enable persistent data storage. The previous enhancement incorporated a Binary Search Tree with the loading of courses through a CSV file, 
        now supports database CRUD operations using the psycopg2 library to sync between the BST and the database. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Adding these features has enabled me to demonstrate my ability to implement and manage a relational database in Python, handling dynamic data structures
        and maintaining a consistent state across applications. 
        Additionally, I included several unique features like full synchronization, reset options, and data formatting logic for prerequisites that piece together to form a clean and scalable design.
        <br>
        <br>
        Moreover, I encountered several challenges during this implementation, including how to prevent data duplication during sync operations and formatting course relationships to maintain consistent storage. By implementing the sync capability, I was able to solve these 
        issues and improve my understanding of several key areas like database constraints, string manipulation, and modular design patterns. Overall, this enhancement reflects my growth in understanding database interaction, error handling, and overall software design.
        Together, these enhancements demonstrate the skills I've developed across three key areas&mdash;software design, data structures and algorithms, and databases, and showcase my ability to grow and adapt in the field of software development.
